    <title>Git Branching Exercise</title>
</head>
<body>
    <ol>
        <li>The git command for making a branch is git checkout -b</li>
        <li>A fast forward merge can only be done if there haven't been any commits on the branch you are merging to while the new branch was being worked on.</li>
        <li>The git command to switch to another branch is git checkout</li>
        <li>To delete a branch, the command is git branch -D or git branch -df</li>
        <li>Merge conflicts happen when there have been different commits with changes done to the same file. Git can't decide which changes to keep, so it needs a human to decide.</li>
