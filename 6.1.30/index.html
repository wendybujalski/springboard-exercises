        <li>The man command opens up a manual for a particular commend which explains what it does and what flags you can set for it. You can use e to advance one line and y to go back one line. f goes forward one window and b goes backward one window. d goes forward one half-window and u goes backward one half-window. q exits the manual.</li>
        <li>The -l flag for ls makes it use a long listing format. The -a flag for ls makes it not ignore hidden files (ones which start with .)</li>
        <li>option+left/right on MacOS, CTRL+left/right on Windows</li>
        <li>CTRL+e</li>
        <li>CTRL+a</li>
        <li>option+delete on MacOS, alt+backspace on Windows</li>
        <li>The shell is the program which handles commands and manipulates the computer. The terminal is a program (or in the past, some physical hardware) which runs the shell. Modern terminal programs make it easy to interface with a terminal within a GUI operating system.</li>
        <li>An absolute path is a path which shows the location of a file or directory from the root, showing the complete path of directories.</li>
        <li>A relative path is a path which shows the location of a file or directory from the currently selected directory and not from root.</li>
        <li>A flag is an add-on to a BASH command which changes or adds to its functionality. Flags allow one BASH command to do a bunch of related things.</li>
        <li>The -r flag for the rm command stands for "recursive" and makes the rm command remove folders and any subfolders/files inside. f forces the removal of files, suppressing confirmation prompts and errors.</li>
